British Airways Internship from Forage

This repository contains the work completed as part of the British Airways Predictive Modeling Internship from Forage. The project focuses on developing a predictive model to address business questions and improve decision-making processes at British Airways.





## **Project Overview**
##### The main objective of this project is to build and evaluate a predictive model using airline data. The tasks involved in this project include:

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Performed initial data exploration to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within the data.
- Visualized data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.


#### **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
- Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Transformed and normalized data to prepare it for modeling.


#### **Dimensionality Reduction:**
- Applied techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
- Retained essential features while minimizing noise and redundancy.


#### **Feature Encoding:**
- Converted categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- Ensured that the data was in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.


#### **Feature Scaling:**
- Standardized the data to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model.
- Applied scaling techniques like Min-Max scaling or StandardScaler.


#### **Model Building and Evaluation:**
- Selected appropriate machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
  

#### **Model Interpretation and Business Insights:**
- Interpreted the results of the model to draw meaningful business insights.
- Answered key business questions based on the model's predictions and findings.

# British-Airways-Predictive-Modeling-Internship-from-Forage
British Airways Internship from Forage

This repository contains the work completed as part of the British Airways Internship from Forage. The project focuses on developing a predictive model to address business questions and improve decision-making processes at British Airways.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## **Project Overview**
##### The main objective of this project is to build and evaluate a predictive model using airline data.Find business question **Customers booking holidays with British Airways.** The tasks involved in this project include:

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Performed initial data exploration to understand the hidden patterns, structure, distribution,Outliers detection and relationships within the data.
- Visualized data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.


#### **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
- Handled missing values, missing row, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Transformed and normalized and encode data to prepare it for modeling.


#### **Dimensionality Reduction:**
- Applied techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the large number of categorical data.
- Retained essential features while minimizing noise and redundancy.


#### **Feature Encoding:**
- Converted categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like Dummy encoding.
- Ensured that the data was in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.


#### **Feature Scaling:**
- Standardized the data to ensure that the data should be in same Scale and all features contributed equally to the model.
- Applied scaling technique like StandardScaler.


#### **Model Building and Evaluation:**
- Selected appropriate machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
- Increased or tune the model performance using GriedSearchCV.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
  

#### **Model Interpretation and Business Insights:**
- Interpreted the results of the model to draw meaningful business insights.
- Answered key business questions based on the model's predictions and findings.

## **Insights:**

- the 75% people an Number of days spend at destination 28 days.

- the minimum number of days spend at destination 0, and the average day spend at destination is 23.

- number of days between travel date and booking date average 84 days.

- Most of the time 75% flight duration is 8.

- The maximum flight_duration value is 9 and 50% flight duration is 7.

- the average hour of flight departure is 9.

- Maximum Booking Not Completed in Australia and Malaysia very few booking completed on Australia Malaysia and other Countries.

- Maximum flight departure times are between 8 and 12.

- 89% booking has been done through Internet. mostly people prefer internet as compared to Mobile.

- The maximum people prefer to book their seats from Internet and maximum Booking done in Australia and Malaysia from Internet.

- 40.80% bookings have come from Australia and 14.82 bookings have come from Malaysia and 10% booking from South Korea.

- The maximum people prefer to book their seats from Internet and maximum Booking done in Australia and Malaysia from Internet.
